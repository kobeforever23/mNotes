The stock is up 136% YTD, joins the S&P 500 on December 22, 2025, and has a record $9.38B backlog. This document outlines a disciplined strategy to build a $100K position over 60-90 days.

52-Week Range: $276 - $1,037
Market Cap: ~$34B
P/E Ratio: ~40x
Target Average Entry: ~$925

INVESTMENT THESIS

Bull Case:
• S&P 500 inclusion (Dec 22) brings passive fund flows
• Record $9.38B backlog (+65% YoY) provides 2-3 year visibility
• Data center/AI projects now 40%+ of revenue (up from 31% last year)
• Exceptional execution: ROE of 43.6%, margins expanding
• Fortress balance sheet: debt/equity of just 0.06

Key Risks:
• Valuation stretched at 40x P/E - little room for error
• Heavy concentration in tech/data center projects
• Insider selling: 650K+ shares sold since 2021 vs <1K purchased
• Tariff exposure on materials and equipment
• Hyperscaler CapEx slowdown could pressure backlog

POSITION BUILDING STRATEGY: 5-TRANCHE LADDER

Given the stock's volatility (beta 1.64) and elevated valuation, we recommend NOT deploying all capital at once. Instead, ladder into the position over 60-90 days to optimize average cost basis.

TRANCHE 1: Initial Position - THIS WEEK
Amount: $20,000 (20%)
Entry Zone: $960-$975
Estimated Shares: ~21
Rationale: Establish base position before Dec 22 S&P 500 inclusion; capture potential index-driven demand

TRANCHE 2: Post-Inclusion Reaction - DEC 23-27
Amount: $20,000 (20%)
Entry Zone: $920-$960 (on dip) OR $1,000+ (on breakout)
Estimated Shares: ~21-22
Rationale: S&P 500 inclusions often see "sell the news" reactions; alternatively, add on confirmed breakout above all-time highs

TRANCHE 3: Technical Pullback - JANUARY 2026
Amount: $25,000 (25%)
Entry Zone: $880-$920
Estimated Shares: ~28-30
Rationale: Target 50-day moving average (~$924) and psychological $900 support; largest tranche at best prices

TRANCHE 4: Earnings Play - FEBRUARY 2026
Amount: $20,000 (20%)
Entry Zone: Pre-earnings dip or post-beat confirmation
Estimated Shares: ~21-22
Rationale: Q4 2025 earnings release Feb 19, 2026; FIX has beaten estimates by ~30%+ in recent quarters

TRANCHE 5: Opportunistic Reserve - FLEXIBLE
Amount: $15,000 (15%)
Entry Zone: $800-$850 (deep pullback) OR $1,100+ (breakout)
Estimated Shares: Variable
Rationale: Dry powder for market dislocations or momentum confirmation
