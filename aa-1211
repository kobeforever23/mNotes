### 6. AI & Innovation: From Tools to Agentic Platforms

* **Rapid AI adoption at scale**:

  * **0 → 7,000+ GenAI licenses in CIB in ~6 months**.

    * ~2,100 active users; **160,000+ prompts in the last two months**.
    * Power users averaging ~575 prompts each.
  * Senior leadership (including Charlie and senior executives) actively using the same tools, reinforcing cultural adoption.
* **Core AI capability pillars**:

  1. **Document intelligence** (extraction, summarization, document creation).
  2. **Agent framework** for scalable, task-oriented AI agents.
  3. **Market insight tools** for research, summarization, automated content (e.g., slides).
* **Concrete productivity wins**:

  * **Third-party appraisal extraction**: 50–70 datapoints from ~9,000 appraisals/year reduced from **2–4 hours per file to <5 minutes**.

  * Internal platform (**Capion**) provides controlled LLM access for embedding AI into applications and desktops.

### 7. Culture, Talent, and Adoption

* **MD promotions and talent signal**:

  * New MDs publicly recognized; expectation set that promotion comes with **higher standards and increased contribution**.
  * Clear emphasis on **promoting from within** while selectively hiring top external talent.
* **AI culture embedded at the grassroots level**:

  * Desk-level “AI councils,” “prompt of the week,” and recurring agenda slots for AI use-case sharing.
  * India CIB teams completed **GenAI 100** training en masse (with many going further), a model for bottom-up capability building.
  * Regular “Innovation Pulse” updates and upcoming “Innovate Day” events (NY in March; aspiration for London) to maintain momentum.
* **Operating philosophy**:

### 8. Enterprise Connectivity & Cross-Segment Opportunity

* **Deeper CIB–CB–WIM integration**:

  * Key account management program maturing; focus on **delivering a “single Wells Fargo”** to top clients.

* **GPL and payments as under-penetrated growth levers**:

  * GPL strategy being refreshed with sharper data-driven wallet targeting.
  * Real estate GPL specifically noted as **under-penetrated** versus banking, with clear upside.
* **Post–asset cap mindset shift**:

---

### 9. Risk Appetite, Discipline, and “Sand in the Gears”

* **Balanced risk posture** post–asset cap:

  * Willing to do things we previously avoided purely to dodge scrutiny (e.g., very large underwrites), but only where **risk-return is compelling and controlled**.
  * Confidence anchored in current **$19B+ revenue and strong after-tax profitability** – no “must-do” deals to survive.
* **Operational friction reduction (“removing sand in the gears”)**:

  * Significant progress eliminating unnecessary pain points and internal bureaucracy.
  * AI and automation (e.g., Socrates in Markets) expected to drive **step-change efficiency**, not just incremental improvement.

---

### 10. 2026 Priorities & Expectations

* **Sustain and deepen growth**:

  * Repeat the last 4–5 years’ revenue growth (~$4–5B) again over the next three years, while **also growing profits**.
  * Continue to invest in **talent, technology, AI, and balance sheet** while improving returns.
* **Sharpen client-wallet focus**:

  * Move further from product-centric to **client-centric, wallet-penetration** mindset across markets and banking.
  * Proactively target “white space” wallets, sectors, and geographies where we are underweight.
* **Scale AI from experimentation to embedded fabric**:

  * Make agentic AI and LLM-enabled workflows standard across front office, risk, operations, and technology.
  * Measure impact not just in classic ROI terms, but in **first utilization, capacity creation, and client impact**.
* **Raise the bar on performance**:

  * Senior message: **“If we do in 2026 what we did in 2025, that will not be good enough.”**
  * Leaders are explicitly expected to come back from the holidays rested, reflective, and ready to be **materially better** in 2026.
