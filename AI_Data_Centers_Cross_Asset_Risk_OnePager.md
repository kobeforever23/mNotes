# AI / Data Centers — Cross-Asset Risk One-Pager

**For CIB CRO | Large U.S. Bank**  
**As of January 22, 2026** — All 2025 figures are full-year unless otherwise stated.

## 1. What's True Right Now (Confirmed, Data-Backed)

### Structured Credit Exposure Concentrated in Large-Loan CMBS (SASB)

- **Private-label CMBS issuance (2025):** $125.6B total; **SASB: $91.3B** (~73% of issuance, excl. CLOs)
- **Largest SASB deal of 2025:** BX Commercial Mortgage Trust 2025-VOLT ($3.45B) — 9 data centers, 214.9 MW capacity across 6 states

### Data-Center ABS Is Scaling with Distinct Structures

- **Example:** Centersquare Series 2025-1/2 — 26 data centers, ~150 MW critical load, ~1,081 customers
  - Largest customer: 8.0% of AMRR | Top 20: ~39.7% | WA remaining term: 3.9 years
- **KBRA methodology** formalizes ARD structures and amortization triggers as core credit mechanics

### Sector Fundamentals Remain Tight — "Deliverable MW" Is the Constraint

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| North America primary-market vacancy (Q2 2025) | 1.7% |
| Under construction | 6,350.1 MW (82.7% preleased) |
| Northern Virginia pipeline | 2,078.2 MW |
| Phoenix pipeline | 1,611.4 MW |
| Hyperscale all-in dev cost (2020 → 2025 → 2026E) | ~$5M/MW → ~$12M/MW → ~$14M/MW |

### Power Market / Interconnection Policy Moving into Cash-Flow Critical Path

- **PJM (Jan 16, 2026):** Board actions to integrate new data centers and large loads, including pathways for loads to bring their own generation or enter "connect and manage" frameworks with earlier curtailment, plus backstop generation procurement
- **ERCOT (Jan 2026):** Large-load interconnection queue surged to **99,239 MW** (from 24,642 MW); 225 new requests in 2025 vs. 39 in 2024

### Hyperscaler Financing Already Affecting Corporate Credit

- **2025 bond issuance (5 hyperscalers):** $121B vs. $28B annual average (2020–2024)
- **2026 projections:** Barclays forecasts $2.46T total U.S. corporate supply; BofA estimates hyperscalers could issue ~$140B annually (potentially >$300B in some scenarios)

## 2. Where CIB Exposure Actually Sits (Cross-Asset Map)

### A. Real Estate Credit / Securitized Products

| Exposure Type | Key Risk Considerations |
|---------------|------------------------|
| **SASB CMBS (primary locus)** | Underwriting/warehousing, secondary trading, repo financing, risk retention, investor holdings — concentrated in a small set of very large loans (e.g., BX 2025-VOLT $3.45B) |
| **Conduit CMBS** | Smaller DC exposure, but correlation risk matters (spread widening/financing stress across CRE even if DC collateral performs) |

### B. ABS / Structured Credit

| Exposure Type | Key Risk Considerations |
|---------------|------------------------|
| **Colocation ABS** | Cash flows driven by customer churn/renewal economics; concentration measurable (e.g., largest customer 8% AMRR) |
| **Structural focus** | ARD/trigger regime and performance-linked amortization |

### C. Corporate & Leveraged Finance

| Exposure Type | Key Risk Considerations |
|---------------|------------------------|
| **Hyperscaler corporate debt** | Direct underwriting, secondary exposure, CDS; rising issuance and hedging activity |
| **DC operators / REITs / sponsors** | Revolvers, term loans, bridge facilities, bond underwriting, private-credit syndication — sponsor concentration is often the hidden linkage |

### D. Power & Infrastructure Finance + Commodities

| Exposure Type | Key Risk Considerations |
|---------------|------------------------|
| **Project finance / infra lending** | Generation, substations, transmission upgrades, microgrids tied to large-load growth |
| **Commodities / power hedging** | Basis and capacity mechanisms, collateral posting/margining; risk increases where "connect and manage" implies curtailment/backup generation regimes |

## 3. CRO View: 5 Highest-Signal Risk Channels

| Priority | Risk Channel | Description |
|:--------:|--------------|-------------|
| **1** | Power delivery / interconnection timing | Revenue start risk → DSCR + extension/refi risk — largest single underwriting error mode today |
| **2** | Tenant/customer concentration & rollover | Binary outcomes in hyperscale; churn economics in colocation |
| **3** | Refinancing cliffs (ARD / extension tests) | Spread + rate volatility exposure, especially floating-rate large loans |
| **4** | Capex escalation / obsolescence ("wrong vintage") | Residual value / liquidation haircut risk — replacement cost rising fast |
| **5** | Rule/regime risk in power markets | PJM/ISO actions can shift cost allocation, curtailment probability, and "firmness" of delivered MW |

---

## 4. Next 3–12 Months: Catalysts That Can Change Outcomes

| Catalyst | Watch For |
|----------|-----------|
| **PJM implementation + FERC filings** | "Connect and manage" curtailment frameworks, backstop procurement specifics |
| **ERCOT large-load process tightening** | Sequencing delays, upgrade scope changes, policy shocks as queue volume expands |
| **Hyperscaler funding cycle (2026)** | Higher corporate supply and hedging activity affecting spreads/valuations; counterparty pressure in stress scenarios |

---

## 5. No-Regrets Monitoring Pack (Institution-Wide)

### A. Portfolio Inventory Fields (Single Schema Across Balance Sheet + Underwriting + Trading)

| Field Category | Required Fields |
|----------------|-----------------|
| **Sponsor** | Sponsor / ultimate sponsor group |
| **Market** | NoVA / Dallas / Phoenix / etc. |
| **Asset profile** | Hyperscale vs. colocation; # sites; **MW built / contracted / delivered** (3 fields) |
| **Concentration** | Tenant/customer concentration (Top 1/5/20) + WA remaining term |
| **Debt structure** | Fixed/floating; maturity; **ARD/extension tests**; reserves; hedges |
| **Power status** | Utility/ISO; interconnection milestone; energization date; curtailment language |

### B. Watchlist Triggers (Executive-Level)

| Trigger | Threshold |
|---------|-----------|
| Delivered MW < Contracted MW | Any material threshold *or* energization slippage >90 days |
| Single tenant/customer concentration | >35% (or any single-tenant hyperscale without documented re-tenant path) |
| Near-term maturity stress | <24 months to ARD/maturity with refi proceeds sensitivity <1.2x DSCR |
| Capex escalation | $/MW rising without matched pricing/renewal uplift (use JLL cost trend as macro flag) |

## Executive Summary: What This Means for You

**Where the exposure sits:** The center of gravity for AI/data-center exposure in structured credit is **SASB CMBS + specialty ABS**, but the dominant tail risk is **power deliverability/regime** — now being explicitly embedded into grid-operator frameworks (PJM) and queue dynamics (ERCOT).

**The surprise scenario:** The cross-asset linkage that can surprise the firm is not "data centers blow up" — it is **synchronized stress** across:

1. Large-loan refi cliffs
2. Power-linked delays and cost allocations  
3. A heavier hyperscaler funding cycle impacting spreads, hedging, and counterparty liquidity
