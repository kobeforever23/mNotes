Below is a **senior-markets-exec executive summary** of the major **publicly available 2026 outlook “reports”** released (mostly in late 2025) by top institutions—**Goldman Sachs (GSAM + GS Research public pieces), J.P. Morgan (Asset Management + Private Bank), Morgan Stanley (Research + IM), Bank of America (Global Research + CIO), BlackRock Investment Institute, UBS, Wells Fargo Investment Institute**—plus a few **load‑bearing “street consensus” datapoints** from Reuters and credit-market monitoring (rating-agency commentary via Reuters / S&P Global Ratings).

A key constraint: a lot of “true” bank research is proprietary/paywalled. Where I couldn’t access the underlying full document (e.g., some JPM Global Research pages), I’ve anchored to **the institution’s public outlook material and/or Reuters’ compilation of broker forecasts**, and I’m explicit about what’s sourced vs. synthesized.

## The 2026 regime in one sentence

**2026 is widely framed as a “still-expanding but more fragile” cycle**: pro-growth policy mix + AI/infra capex + easing (or easier) monetary stance can keep risk assets supported, **but the dominant risk is that abundant liquidity + concentrated leadership turns into either (a) an inflation relapse or (b) an AI/asset-bubble air‑pocket**—and the hedging assumptions that worked in prior cycles (USD always up in stress, stocks/bonds always diversifying) are being questioned. ([JPMorgan][1])

---

## What “top houses” broadly agree on (the real consensus)

### 1) Growth continues, but dispersion (by sector/region) matters more than the index level

* **Morgan Stanley Research** expects global growth around the low‑3% range in 2026 and emphasizes a “range of possibilities,” with U.S. consumption and AI capex central to the base case. ([Morgan Stanley][2])
* **UBS** frames the macro backdrop as supportive for equities as confidence improves and fiscal impulse gains traction, with tariff effects fading over time. ([Brazil][3])
* **J.P. Morgan Asset Management (Market Insights)** explicitly says markets are resilient and expects expansion to continue with activity broadening across regions—while warning that “excess stimulus” historically shows up as inflation and/or asset bubbles. ([JPMorgan][1])

**Executive implication:** 2026 looks less like “beta-only” and more like **a dispersion/selection market** (region, sector, balance-sheet quality, and financing dependency). Expect **higher cross-asset and intra-asset dispersion**, not necessarily a straight-line bear market. ([JPMorgan][1])

---

### 2) AI remains the core macro equity driver—but the street is obsessed with “ROI math” and concentration risk

* **BlackRock Investment Institute**: the “micro is macro” point—AI buildout by a handful of firms is large enough to move macro data; the key challenge is whether future AI revenues match today’s capex “orders of magnitude.” They stay pro‑risk / overweight U.S. stocks on AI, but explicitly call out leverage and concentration dynamics. ([BlackRock][4])
* **J.P. Morgan Private Bank** frames 2026 as “Promise and Pressure” driven by **AI, fragmentation, inflation**, and argues you “can’t have a view on markets without a view on AI,” citing AI-related firms as a dominant share of recent S&P gains/earnings/capex growth (their characterization). ([J.P. Morgan Private Bank][5])
* **J.P. Morgan AM** makes “Navigate tech concentration carefully” one of four flagship calls to action and links the risk to questions about ROI on enormous AI capex and rising leverage used to support it. ([JPMorgan][1])
* **Goldman Sachs Asset Management** notes S&P concentration is very high (top 10 ~40% of market cap) and says AI capex has largely been internally financed so far but increasing reliance on debt bears monitoring in 2026. ([Goldman Sachs Asset Management][6])
* **Reuters’ broker roundup** reinforces that the Street still expects AI to stay central in 2026 strategies, but flags inflation surprises, lofty valuations, and tariff tensions as correction triggers. ([Reuters][7])

**Executive implication:**
The most important “CIO-to-trading-floor” bridge in 2026 is **AI capex → funding/leverage → term premium/credit issuance → equity multiples**. If you’re not mapping that transmission, you’re flying blind. ([BlackRock][4])

---

### 3) Policy mix is unusually procyclical: easing + fiscal/industrial policy in a non-recession environment

* **Morgan Stanley IM (The BEAT)** explicitly says fiscal + monetary policy has “turned procyclical,” and their base narrative is the trough was in 2025 with room for a broadening recovery in 2026. 
* **J.P. Morgan AM** highlights the unusual scale of fiscal deficits/rate cuts “outside of recessions.” ([JPMorgan][1])
* **Wells Fargo Investment Institute** frames a “rare but positive signal”: rate cuts while the economy is still growing, with tariff impacts seen as more diffused than the positive combo of deregulation + tax cuts; they also expect AI spend to broaden across sectors. ([Wells Fargo Advisors][8])
* **BofA** forecasts stronger-than-expected growth and explicitly expects additional Fed cuts in 2026 (per their economists/strategists). ([Bank of America][9])

**Executive implication:**
Procyclical policy can **extend** the cycle, but it also tends to **increase tail risk** (inflation relapse, bubbles, term premium spikes, political/trade shocks). Your risk framework should treat 2026 as “late mid‑cycle with policy accelerant,” not “classic early-cycle.” ([JPMorgan][1])

---

### 4) Rates: many expect easing pressure on the front end; debate is really about the long end (term premium / fiscal dominance)

* **BofA rates strategy** expects 10Y to end 2026 around 4.0–4.25 with “risks to the downside,” alongside two Fed cuts in 2026 (plus a cut at Dec 2025 per their economists). ([Bank of America][9])
* **Wells Fargo** projects Fed funds down to ~3.00–3.25 by end‑2026 and 10Y in ~4.00–4.50; they also explicitly see opportunities from **steepening yield spreads between short and long maturities**. ([Wells Fargo Advisors][8])
* **Morgan Stanley IM (The BEAT)** shows an “underweight duration in the U.S. with a yield curve steepening bias.” 
* **BlackRock** is tactically underweight long-term Treasuries, arguing investors may demand more term premium in a more levered system. ([BlackRock][4])

**Executive implication:**
The street’s most tradable macro disagreement for 2026 is **(a) steepening vs. bull-flattening** and **(b) whether long-end term premium becomes the shock-absorber or the shock-amplifier**. 

---

### 5) Credit & private credit: carry still matters, but scrutiny is rising (defaults, underwriting vintage, bank/NDFI linkages)

* **GSAM** says recent “credit events” increased scrutiny of bank exposure to NDFIs and highlights that private equity + private credit loans across 7 large U.S. banks are ~11% of their total loans (their cited figure), while viewing recent issues as idiosyncratic—not broad systemic credit risk—yet emphasizing active selection and rigorous underwriting/surveillance in private credit. ([Goldman Sachs Asset Management][6])
* **GSAM’s private credit deep dive**: ~15% of private credit borrowers (their estimate) are not covering interest with EBITDA; they argue rate cuts only marginally relieve the stressed cohort and describe PIK prevalence and vintage risk (notably 2021 exposures in evergreen structures). ([Goldman Sachs Asset Management][6])
* **BofA** explicitly calls for **lower private credit returns** (5.4% cited) and suggests HY may look more attractive on a relative basis. ([Bank of America][9])
* **Reuters / Morningstar DBRS** warns of more private credit defaults in 2026 as borrower pressures intensify, and notes regulators (e.g., BoE) increasing oversight/stress testing focus. ([Reuters][10])

**Executive implication:**
Expect **more client demand for transparency, liquidity terms, vintage/underwriting analytics, and hedges** around private credit and levered exposures—plus potential **basis opportunities** where public HY and “private yield” compete for the same marginal allocator. ([Goldman Sachs Asset Management][6])

---

## Where the houses differ (and why it matters to a markets franchise)

### Equity upside: “still up” vs “muted” is mainly a *multiple* debate, not an earnings debate

* **BofA equity strategy** expects strong EPS growth (14% cited) but only modest S&P price appreciation (4–5%) with a 7,100 target—i.e., multiple compression / valuation gravity. ([Bank of America][9])
* **Wells Fargo** posts a higher range (7,400–7,600) with EPS ~$300 and emphasizes earnings-led gains rather than P/E expansion. ([Wells Fargo Advisors][8])
* **Citi (via Reuters)** sets 7,700 target, still AI-driven, and explicitly expects volatility; provides bull/bear cases. ([Reuters][11])
* **Reuters poll (in Reuters AI piece)** points to ~7,490 end‑2026 consensus in that compilation (context: broker forecasts). ([Reuters][12])

**Exec/trading takeaway:**
The “index level” argument is less important than **(1) breadth/leadership rotation, (2) volatility regime, and (3) correlation structure**—because those drive flow, structuring demand, and risk utilization. ([Wells Fargo Advisors][8])

---

## Cross-asset “best ideas” (expressed as actionable themes, not single-name calls)

What follows is the **highest-signal set of themes** that repeatedly show up across the big outlooks, translated into how **a CIB Markets leadership team / top traders / risk** would actually use them.

### Theme A — “Capex cycle” replaces “consumer-only” as the marginal driver

* BofA explicitly watches for a shift from a consumption-driven bull market to a capex-driven one. ([Bank of America][9])
* BofA CIO highlights the data-center buildout intensity and policy/tax support narratives. ([Bank of America Private Bank][13])
* BlackRock frames the AI buildout as capital-intensive and macro-relevant. ([BlackRock][4])
* Wells Fargo argues tax incentives + deregulation + lower short-term rates + AI investment broaden capex across the industrial backbone. ([Wells Fargo Advisors][8])

**How to monetize (Markets lens):**

* **Equity derivatives / dispersion:** capex beneficiaries vs capex financers vs capex “adopters” sets up structurally higher dispersion (index vol may not fully reflect single-name dispersion). ([BlackRock][4])
* **Rates/credit:** capex boom + debt-financing “hump” elevates issuance calendars and refinancing sensitivity; opportunity in **new-issue concessions, RV along curves, and hedging packages**. ([BlackRock][4])

---

### Theme B — Tech concentration is a *risk factor* and a *product opportunity*

JPM AM and GSAM both flag concentration/ROI scrutiny; JPM PB makes AI one of 3 defining forces. ([JPMorgan][1])

**How to monetize:**

* **Structured equity:** “concentration-aware” payoff design (defined downside, participation, autocall/contingent buffers) becomes more compelling when clients fear “AI narrative air‑pocket” but don’t want to exit. ([JPMorgan][1])
* **Hedging packages:** JPM AM explicitly discusses hedging an AI-driven correction with high-quality long-duration bonds in a disinflationary shock scenario. ([JPMorgan][1])

---

### Theme C — Hedge assumptions are shifting (stocks/bonds correlation, USD safe haven)

GSAM explicitly warns that traditional hedges rely on assumptions (negative equity-rates correlation; USD as safe haven) that are challenged, motivating a broader hedge toolkit and explicit tail-risk hedging frameworks. ([Goldman Sachs Asset Management][6])

**Risk management translation (practical):**

* Treat “classic 60/40 convexity” as **scenario-dependent**, not structural. ([Goldman Sachs Asset Management][6])
* Build a **multi-hedge stack**: rates vol + equity crash convexity + FX/commodity “fragmentation” hedges (gold/resources show up explicitly in JPM PB). ([Goldman Sachs Asset Management][6])

---

### Theme D — Curve steepening bias is a recurring motif (even among otherwise bullish houses)

* Morgan Stanley IM: steepening bias and underweight duration in the U.S. 
* Wells Fargo: steepening yield spreads create opportunities. ([Wells Fargo Advisors][8])
* BlackRock: term premium risk drives tactical underweight in long Treasuries. ([BlackRock][4])

**Trading translation:**

* 2026 is set up for more **curve shape trading** (2s10s/5s30s, forward steepeners) and more **volatility around fiscal/issuance headlines** than a simple “rates down” trade. ([BlackRock][4])

---

### Theme E — Real assets split: industrial metals constructive; energy more range-bound; gold remains a hedge

* **Goldman Sachs Research (public)** expects copper to be range-bound ~10k–11k in 2026, with structural grid/power demand longer term; it also highlights tariff risk as a swing factor. ([Goldman Sachs][14])
* **BofA** expects copper supported by tight supply and tailwinds like easier policy and demand. ([Bank of America][9])
* **Morgan Stanley (commodities outlook)** sees broad commodities more optimistic, with energy markets seeking stability and oil potentially remaining moderate given supply dynamics. ([Morgan Stanley][15])
* **Morgan Stanley via Reuters** forecasts gold higher (to a cited level), but with slower gains, supported by rate cuts/weaker USD dynamics. ([Reuters][16])
* **Wells Fargo** sees limited broad commodity upside due to oversupplied energy, but favors precious and industrial metals. ([WF][17])

**Desk translation:**
Expect more **metals-relative-value**, **option demand around tariff decisions**, and **commodity-as-hedge** flow tied to fragmentation/security narratives. ([Goldman Sachs][14])

---

## “The 7 things a senior CIB Markets executive should do with this” (operating plan)

### 1) Run the franchise with a “two-vol” mindset: index vol may stay contained while single-name/sector/curve vol rises

AI concentration + policy uncertainty + late‑cycle leverage dynamics = higher dispersion even when beta looks calm. ([BlackRock][4])

**Action:** prioritize businesses that monetize dispersion: **equity deriv flow/dispersion**, **rates vol**, **macro RV**, **credit hedging**, and **cross-asset correlation** products. ([Goldman Sachs Asset Management][6])

---

### 2) Put AI capex financing on the same dashboard as macro risk

BlackRock’s “leveraging up” and JPM AM’s leverage/ROI concerns are effectively telling you: **issuance + funding conditions are part of the AI thesis**. ([BlackRock][4])

**Action:** add an “AI financing conditions” panel to your weekly risk/forum pack:

* hyperscaler capex cadence vs guidance,
* credit spread/issuance for AI supply chain,
* data-center/infrastructure financing terms,
* equity breadth indicators. ([BlackRock][4])

---

### 3) Treat private credit as both (a) growth vector and (b) systemic linkage story

GSAM lays out borrower coverage stress pockets and emphasizes surveillance/underwriting; Reuters/DBRS flags rising defaults and rising regulatory attention. ([Goldman Sachs Asset Management][6])

**Action:**

* tighten cross-desk connectivity between **LevFin / Credit Trading / Prime / Risk** on private-credit linkages (NDFIs, bank exposures, and hedging demand). ([Goldman Sachs Asset Management][6])

---

### 4) Revisit hedge frameworks: don’t assume USD up + bonds up in every equity drawdown

GSAM explicitly challenges those assumptions and advocates broader hedging instruments and tail-risk frameworks. ([Goldman Sachs Asset Management][6])

**Action:** institutionalize **multi-hedge** playbooks by scenario (see next section). ([Goldman Sachs Asset Management][6])

---

### 5) Align risk limits with the steepening/term-premium debate

Multiple houses point to steepening bias and long-end vulnerability. 

**Action:** stress liquidity + VAR/ES under “term premium shock” scenarios (rates up, risk assets down, correlation breaks). ([BlackRock][4])

---

### 6) Expect client narratives to converge on: “broaden beyond mega-cap, but don’t miss AI”

That’s explicitly in JPM AM (diversify selectively; navigate concentration), and consistent with the broader Street. ([JPMorgan][1])

**Action:** build packaged solutions around **AI breadth** (supply chain + adopters + non-US beneficiaries) with built-in downside definitions. ([JPMorgan][1])

---

### 7) Prepare for 2026 to have “policy headlines that matter” (tariffs/immigration/fiscal), not just noise

Morgan Stanley Research explicitly cites tariffs/immigration as swing factors; WFII expects tariff impacts early then improvement; JPM PB emphasizes fragmentation; Reuters flags tariffs as correction catalyst. ([Morgan Stanley][2])

**Action:** pre-wire event hedges and client playbooks for tariff escalations and inflation re-acceleration. ([Goldman Sachs][14])

---

## The 2026 scenario grid (what traders + risk should actually run)

### Scenario 1 — “AI air-pocket” (narrative break / ROI disappointment)

**Signature:** equities down (esp. concentrated leaders), credit spreads wider; disinflation impulse possible if capex retrenches; funding stress risk if leverage is crowded. ([JPMorgan][1])

**Hedges suggested/consistent with sources:**

* high-quality long-duration rates as buffer (JPM AM explicitly mentions this hedge logic) ([JPMorgan][1])
* explicit tail-risk hedging / convexity (GSAM) ([Goldman Sachs Asset Management][6])

---

### Scenario 2 — “Inflation relapse / fiscal dominance / term premium spike”

**Signature:** long-end yields up, equity multiples compress, correlation between equities and bonds can turn unhelpful. ([BlackRock][4])

**Risk actions:**

* steepener risk controls;
* watch long-end liquidity and Treasury auction dynamics;
* diversify hedges beyond “just duration.” ([BlackRock][4])

---

### Scenario 3 — “Fragmentation shock” (tariffs/geopolitics/currency volatility)

**Signature:** FX vol up; commodities (esp. gold/resources) bid; region/sector dispersion spikes. ([J.P. Morgan Private Bank][5])

**Hedges/expressions appearing in the outlooks:** gold and natural resources as hedges in a fragmented world (JPM PB). ([J.P. Morgan Private Bank][5])

---

### Scenario 4 — “Private credit stress migrates” (defaults + liquidity terms + bank/NDFI feedback loops)

**Signature:** spread widening in relevant pockets; NAV gating / redemption friction; higher demand for public-market hedges; regulatory spotlight. ([Goldman Sachs Asset Management][6])

**Risk actions:**

* tighter monitoring of counterparties with private-credit linkages;
* stress evergreen structures/vintage;
* client comms + hedging pathways. ([Goldman Sachs Asset Management][6])

---

## A clean “board-slide” takeaway

If you need one concise framing that matches the major houses:

**2026 Base Case:** Expansion continues, supported by easing financial conditions + pro-growth policy + AI/infra capex broadening. ([Morgan Stanley][2])
**But:** The cycle is increasingly dominated by (i) **concentration**, (ii) **leverage/financing dynamics**, and (iii) **policy/fragmentation shocks**. ([BlackRock][4])
**So:** 2026 is a year to **run risk deliberately** (BlackRock’s “diversification mirage” concept) and monetize **dispersion + hedging demand**, not just directional beta. ([BlackRock][4])
