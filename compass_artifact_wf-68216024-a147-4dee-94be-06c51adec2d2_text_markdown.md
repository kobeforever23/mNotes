# Global Markets 2025: Year in Review
## Cross-Asset, Evidence-Based, Institutional Pack

---

# SECTION A — EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Bottom Line Up Front:** 2025 will be remembered as the year markets survived their worst tariff shock since the 1930s and delivered double-digit equity returns despite a 43-day government shutdown, a Federal Reserve pivot, and unprecedented policy uncertainty. The S&P 500 gained **+16.4%**, marking a third consecutive year of double-digit returns, while international markets staged their strongest outperformance versus the US since 2009. Gold delivered its best year since 1979 (+65%), the US dollar posted its worst annual decline since 2017 (-9.6%), and oil fell nearly 20% on OPEC+ supply unwinds.

---

## The 5–10 defining market themes of 2025, ranked by impact

1. **"Liberation Day" tariff shock and V-shaped recovery** — The April 2-9 crash erased $5+ trillion in US market value in days; full recovery took just 60 days
2. **Fed's measured pivot** — Three 25bp cuts (September through December) brought Fed funds to 3.50-3.75%, with rising dissent signaling the easing cycle's end
3. **US government shutdown data blackout** — The 43-day shutdown (October 1 – November 12) created a critical economic data gap, forcing the Fed to cut rates "flying blind"
4. **International and EM outperformance** — MSCI ACWI ex-USA (+29.2%) and MSCI EM (+34.4%) materially outpaced the S&P 500 for the first time since 2020
5. **Precious metals supercycle acceleration** — Gold (+65%) and silver (+144%) posted their best annual returns since 1979
6. **Bank of Japan normalization milestone** — BOJ raised rates to 0.75% (highest since 1995), 10-year JGB yields hit 25-year highs at 2.09%
7. **AI concentration and Magnificent 7 bifurcation** — Only Alphabet (+65%) and Nvidia (+39%) meaningfully beat the S&P 500; Amazon (+5%) was the worst performer
8. **China deflation entrenchment** — PPI deflation extended to 32 consecutive months; GDP deflator negative for 9 quarters
9. **Credit resilience** — HY spreads nearly doubled on Liberation Day (258→461bps) but snapped back within weeks
10. **Crypto regulatory clarity emerges** — GENIUS Act created first federal stablecoin framework; SEC/CFTC coordination dramatically improved

1. **Fed easing cycle is nearly complete** — December dot plot shows only 1 cut in 2026; policy rate approaching neutral at 3.50%
2. **International diversification finally pays** — 2025 broke the "US exceptionalism" streak; allocators will likely increase non-US exposure
3. **Tariff policy is now a structural market factor** — Liberation Day framework creates ongoing pricing uncertainty; trade deals will drive sector rotation
4. **BOJ normalization creates global duration risk** — Japanese investors may repatriate capital as domestic yields rise; global bond supply/demand dynamics shifting
5. **Precious metals super-cycle intact** — Central bank buying, de-dollarization themes, and fiscal concerns support sustained gold demand above $4,000

# SECTION B — GLOBAL MACRO BACKDROP (DATA-BACKED)

## Growth and inflation trends by region

### United States
GDP growth exceeded expectations despite tariff disruption. Q1 contracted -0.6% on tariff-induced import front-running, but Q2 rebounded +3.8% and Q3 surged +4.3% (strongest in two years). Full-year 2025 growth estimated at **~2.5%**. The labor market softened gradually, with unemployment rising from 4.1% (January) to **4.6%** (November, 4-year high). Core CPI fell from 3.1% to **2.6%** (lowest since March 2021), driven by easing shelter inflation (3.0%) though services remained sticky at 3.8%.

### Eurozone
The ECB's December projections revised 2025 growth to **1.4%** (up from 1.2%), with Spain (+2.5%) outperforming while Germany stagnated (+0.1%). HICP inflation averaged **2.1%** for the year, with core at 2.4%. Services inflation remained sticky above 3%. Germany's historic debt brake suspension for defense/infrastructure spending is expected to boost growth 0.5% by 2028.

### United Kingdom
The UK faced persistent stagflation concerns. GDP contracted -0.1% (August-October), the first three-month decline since December 2023. Full-year growth estimated at **~1.25%**. CPI peaked at 3.8% (September) before easing to 3.2% (November). Unemployment rose to **5.1%** (highest since 2015), while wage growth moderated to 4.7%.

### Japan
Japan's deflation escape continued but growth remained subdued at **~0.5%** for 2025, held back by tariff headwinds. Core CPI stayed above 2% for nearly four years. The Shunto wage increases of 5.4% for major firms signaled structural wage growth normalization. The BOJ's historic rate hikes to 0.75% marked the end of ultra-loose monetary policy.

### China
Official GDP growth hit the **"around 5%"** target (Q1: 5.4%, Q2: 5.2%, Q3: 4.8%), but deflation remained the dominant theme. CPI was essentially flat year-on-year; PPI deflation extended to **32 consecutive months** at -2.6%; the GDP deflator was negative for **9 consecutive quarters** at -1.3%. Property prices remained down 40% from 2021 peaks in some cities.

### Key Emerging Markets
**Brazil** grew ~2.5% with BCB hiking aggressively to 15.00% (highest since 2006) on inflation concerns. **India** maintained ~6.5% growth with RBI cutting 25bps in December. **Mexico** slowed to ~1.5% on manufacturing weakness. **Turkey** stabilized around 3% growth with CBRT holding at 45%.

## Central bank policy paths and inflection points

### Federal Reserve
The Fed delivered **three 25bp cuts** in 2025, bringing the target range from 4.25-4.50% to **3.50-3.75%**.

| Date | Decision | Rate | Vote | Context |
|------|----------|------|------|---------|
| Jan 28-29 | HOLD | 4.25-4.50% | Unanimous | Inflation concerns |
| Mar 18-19 | HOLD | 4.25-4.50% | Unanimous | Tariff uncertainty |
| May 6-7 | HOLD | 4.25-4.50% | Unanimous | Labor resilient |
| June 17-18 | HOLD | 4.25-4.50% | Unanimous | Wait-and-see |
| July 29-30 | HOLD | 4.25-4.50% | Unanimous | Data dependency |
| **Sep 16-17** | **-25bp** | **4.00-4.25%** | Majority | First cut; labor concerns |
| **Oct 28-29** | **-25bp** | **3.75-4.00%** | Split | Continued easing |
| **Dec 9-10** | **-25bp** | **3.50-3.75%** | **9-3** | Hawkish cut; 3 dissents |

Powell's December statement: *"We are well positioned to wait and see how the economy evolves"* and *"We're in the high end of the range of neutral."* The December dot plot projected only **1 cut in 2026**.

### European Central Bank
The ECB completed its easing cycle with a final 25bp cut in June, bringing the deposit rate to **2.00%** where it remained through year-end (four consecutive holds). Total 2024-2025 cutting cycle: **8 cuts totaling 200bp**.

### Bank of England
The BOE delivered **three 25bp cuts** in 2025 (May, August, December), bringing Bank Rate to **3.75%**. All votes were narrow (5-4), reflecting persistent inflation concerns.

### Bank of Japan
The BOJ's normalization accelerated dramatically. After exiting negative rates in March 2024, the BOJ raised rates to **0.75%** in December 2025—the highest since 1995. The 10-year JGB yield surged to **2.09%** (25-year high), while 30-year yields hit a record **3.43%**.

### PBoC
China's central bank cut the 7-day reverse repo to 1.4%, reduced the 1-year LPR by 30bp to 3.15%, and cut RRR by 50bp releasing ~CNY 1 trillion in liquidity. Mortgage rates for first-time buyers fell to 2.6%.

---

## Fiscal policy, deficits, issuance, and debt dynamics

### United States
The FY2025 budget deficit reached **$1.8 trillion**. The debt ceiling was raised by $5 trillion (to $41.1 trillion) via the "Big Beautiful Bill" on July 4. Total federal debt outstanding: **~$37.4 trillion**. Interest payments now exceed defense spending. CBO estimates the new legislation adds $3.4 trillion to deficits over the decade.

### Europe
Germany suspended its constitutional debt brake for defense and infrastructure spending—a historic shift expected to boost euro area GDP. France experienced political instability affecting bond markets, while Italy maintained elevated but stable debt-to-GDP ratios.

### Japan
Despite gross public debt at **~240% of GDP** (highest globally), Japan's budget deficit narrowed to 2.2% of GDP (32-year low). The BOJ's balance sheet remained at 118% of GDP.

### China
Macro leverage hit a record **286.1% of GDP** in Q3. Net government bond financing in H1 2025 reached CNY 6.31 trillion (+CNY 3.81T YoY). The government announced CNY 500 billion in special Treasury bonds for bank recapitalization.

## Labor markets, real wages, productivity

US nonfarm payrolls weakened significantly in H2 2025, with October posting **-105,000** jobs (first negative print since pandemic) and November recovering only **+64,000**. Wage growth decelerated to **+3.5% YoY** (November), the lowest since May 2021. The unemployment rate rose steadily from 4.1% (January) to **4.6%** (November), approaching Sahm Rule recession indicators. Eurozone unemployment remained stable at 5.9%, while UK unemployment jumped to 5.1% (highest since 2015).

# SECTION D — WHAT ACTUALLY DROVE MARKETS

## Changes in macro expectations

Markets entered 2025 expecting 100-150bps of Fed cuts; they received only 75bps. The shift from "higher for longer" to "measured easing" materialized in September, driven by labor market softening (unemployment 4.1%→4.6%) rather than inflation concerns. Growth expectations improved as Q3 GDP printed +4.3%, the strongest in two years.

## Shifts in risk premia

The **term premium** regime shift was profound. The 10-year ACM term premium surged to 0.80% (highest since 2011) on January 13, driven by fiscal deficit concerns ($1.8T), heavy Treasury issuance, and inflation uncertainty. This represented a fundamental repricing of duration risk.

**Equity risk premium** compressed as the S&P 500 P/E expanded despite higher real yields—justified by AI-driven earnings growth expectations. **Credit risk premium** touched generational tights before Liberation Day stress-tested resilience.

## Positioning and flows

CTA and volatility-control funds amplified the April drawdown through systematic deleveraging. Real money flows shifted dramatically toward international equities—MSCI ACWI ex-USA saw sustained inflows. Foreign investors purchased **$309 billion** in US bonds in the 12 months through July (+18% YoY), absorbing heavy Treasury supply.

## Driver map (text-based causal arrows)

```
Liberation Day Tariffs (Apr 2) → VIX spike to 60 → CTA deleveraging → Equity selloff (-12.4%)
                                                                    ↓
Tariff pause (Apr 9) → VIX collapse → Systematic re-risking → V-shaped recovery

Fed labor concerns → Sept rate cut → USD weakness (-9.6%) → International outperformance
                                   ↓
Lower real rates → Gold surge (+65%) → Central bank buying → Safe haven demand

BOJ normalization → JGB yields to 25-year highs → Carry trade pressure → Yen volatility
                  ↓
Global duration risk repricing → Term premium regime shift → Long-end underperformance

# SECTION F — DEEP DIVES (Key 2025 Themes)

## 1. Liberation Day: The tariff shock that didn't break markets

**Start-of-year consensus**: Trade tensions would be managed; no repeat of 2018-19 tariff war intensity.

**What actually happened**: Trump's April 2 "Liberation Day" declaration imposed 10% baseline tariffs plus country-specific rates up to 245% on China—the largest tariff increase since the Smoot-Hawley Act of 1930. The S&P 500 lost **$5+ trillion** in market value over 7 days (-12.4%).

**Data evidence**: VIX spiked to 60.13; HY spreads nearly doubled (258→461bps); 10Y Treasury yield swung from 4.5% to 4.045% and back to 4.5% within 10 days.

**Cross-asset response**: Equities crashed globally; bonds initially rallied (flight to safety) then sold off on inflation fears; gold surged; dollar weakened sharply.

**Second-order effects**: IPO market froze (Klarna, Chime halted plans); supply chain repricing began; companies accelerated nearshoring.

**Who benefited**: Gold (+65%), Japanese equities (+25%), put option holders, short sellers.

**Who suffered**: China-exposed companies (Apple, Amazon), small caps, highly leveraged credit.

**Lessons for 2026**: Trade policy is now a first-order market driver. Tariff pause/escalation cycles create volatility opportunities. Recovery speed (60 days) suggests underlying market resilience.

---

## 2. AI concentration and the Magnificent 7 bifurcation

**Start-of-year consensus**: Magnificent 7 would continue to dominate; AI spending would accelerate.

**What actually happened**: Only **2 of 7** Mag 7 stocks meaningfully beat the S&P 500. Alphabet (+65%) and Nvidia (+39%) delivered, while Amazon (+5%) lagged badly. Mag 7 represents **34.4%** of S&P 500 market cap (up from 12.5% in 2016).

**Data evidence**: Nvidia became the first company to reach $5 trillion market cap; data storage companies (SanDisk +559%, Western Digital +283%) outperformed on AI infrastructure demand.

**Cross-asset response**: Tech sector +24.6% vs S&P +16.4%; QQQ outperformed SPY by ~400bps.

**Second-order effects**: Equal-weight S&P 500 (+9.3%) significantly underperformed cap-weighted (+16.4%), highlighting narrow breadth.

**Lessons for 2026**: AI is real, but picking winners requires selectivity. Infrastructure plays (storage, power) may outperform pure AI software. Market concentration remains a risk factor.

---

## 3. Japan's historic normalization

**Start-of-year consensus**: BOJ would move cautiously; yen would stabilize.

**What actually happened**: BOJ raised rates to **0.75%** (highest since 1995); 10-year JGB yields hit **2.09%** (25-year high); 30-year yields reached record **3.43%**. Japan elected its first female PM (Sanae Takaichi).

**Data evidence**: Nikkei +24-26% (best major market); BOJ balance sheet contracted ¥61.2T in a fiscal quarter (QT acceleration).

**Cross-asset response**: Yen remained volatile but essentially flat vs USD despite rate hikes; European/Japanese carry trades faced unwind pressure.

**Second-order effects**: Global duration risk repriced; term premium surged globally; JGB holders faced mark-to-market losses.

**Lessons for 2026**: BOJ normalization creates ongoing global bond market pressure. Japanese capital repatriation could accelerate if domestic yields continue rising.

---

## 4. International markets end the US exceptionalism streak

**Start-of-year consensus**: US would continue outperforming on AI/growth advantages.

**What actually happened**: MSCI ACWI ex-USA (+29.2%) beat the S&P 500 (+16.4%) by **13 percentage points**—the widest margin since 2009. MSCI EM (+34.4%) was the best-performing equity category.

**Data evidence**: DXY -9.6% (worst since 2017); European banks +65%; Hang Seng +30.6%; Korea KOSPI +76-101%.

**Why it happened**: Dollar weakness provided tailwind; European fiscal expansion (German debt brake suspension); China stimulus hopes; EM carry attractiveness.

**Lessons for 2026**: Currency is a major driver of relative returns. Diversification benefits returned. US concentration risk became tangible.

---

## 5. Precious metals supercycle

**Start-of-year consensus**: Gold would be rangebound at $2,500-2,700; real rates would cap upside.

**What actually happened**: Gold surged **+65%** to $4,310+ (best since 1979); silver +144%; 50+ new all-time highs for gold.

**Data evidence**: Central bank gold purchases +28% QoQ in Q3; World Gold Council reported record demand.

**Drivers**: Fed rate cuts, dollar weakness, fiscal concerns, geopolitical uncertainty, de-dollarization themes.

**Lessons for 2026**: Precious metals have re-emerged as core portfolio diversifiers. Central bank buying provides structural demand floor.

---

## 6. China's deflationary trap

**Start-of-year consensus**: China stimulus would reflate the economy; property stabilization expected.

**What actually happened**: PPI deflation extended to **32 consecutive months**; GDP deflator negative for **9 consecutive quarters**; CPI essentially flat.

**Data evidence**: Property prices remained down 40% from 2021 peaks; consumer confidence stagnant; youth unemployment elevated.

**Policy response**: PBoC cut LPR, RRR; government expanded consumer subsidies; property restrictions eased—all insufficient.

**Lessons for 2026**: China deflation is structural, not cyclical. Comparisons to Japan's lost decades are increasingly relevant. Property deleveraging has years to run.

---

# SECTION G — RISK MANAGER'S VIEW (G-SIB STYLE)

## Top 10 risk factors that dominated 2025

1. **Trade policy uncertainty** — Liberation Day tariffs and pause-escalation cycles
2. **Fed policy path repricing** — From 150bps cut expectations to 75bps reality
3. **Government shutdown/data gaps** — 43 days without critical economic data
4. **Term premium regime shift** — 10Y term premium to 0.80% (highest since 2011)
5. **Japan normalization spillovers** — BOJ rate hikes, JGB yield surge
6. **China deflation persistence** — No policy circuit-breaker
7. **Credit spread dislocation** — HY spreads doubled in days
8. **AI concentration risk** — 2 of 7 Mag 7 stocks drove index
9. **Geopolitical escalation** — Russia-Ukraine stalemate, Middle East tensions
10. **Fiscal sustainability concerns** — $1.8T deficit, debt ceiling drama

---

## Correlation and diversification breakdowns

During the April Liberation Day crisis, correlations spiked across asset classes—equities, credit, and FX moved together in risk-off fashion. Bonds initially provided diversification (10Y rallied to 4.045%) before reversing on inflation fears. Gold remained negatively correlated to equities throughout, providing genuine diversification.

**Key finding**: The 60/40 portfolio faced stress in April as bonds initially rallied then sold off; by year-end, 60/40 delivered strong returns as both legs contributed positively.

---

## Tail risks that materialized vs. didn't

| Tail Risk | Status | Impact |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Trade war escalation | **MATERIALIZED** | Liberation Day crash; V-shaped recovery |
| Government shutdown | **MATERIALIZED** | 43 days; data blackout |
| Fed policy error | **PARTIAL** | Hawkish dissent suggests near-miss |
| China property collapse | **ONGOING** | Slow-burn, not acute |
| EM currency crisis | **DID NOT** | EM FX outperformed |
| US recession | **DID NOT** | Q3 GDP +4.3% |
| Crypto blow-up | **DID NOT** | ETF infrastructure absorbed stress |
| Japan crisis | **DID NOT** | Orderly normalization |

---

## Volatility clustering and stress episodes

VIX exhibited two major spikes: April (Liberation Day, peak 60.13) and October (government shutdown/Fed uncertainty, ~30). Between episodes, volatility compressed to below long-term averages (13.6 vs 17.6 median). MOVE Index followed similar pattern—spike to 140 in April, compression to 60 by year-end.

**Pattern**: 2025 was characterized by "spiky calm"—brief, intense stress episodes followed by rapid normalization.

---

## Liquidity and funding observations

- Fed announced $40B/month Treasury bill purchases in December for reserve management
- Options volume hit record highs (100M+ daily contracts twice)
- 0DTE options provided significant liquidity cushion
- HY issuance remained robust ($57B in September alone)
- Foreign investor Treasury purchases +18% YoY ($309B)
- No systemic funding stress despite government shutdown

---

## REQUIRED: Scenario Table with Probabilities, Triggers, and Asset Impacts

| Scenario | Probability | Key Triggers | S&P 500 | 10Y UST | DXY | Gold | HY Spreads |
|----------|-------------|--------------|---------|---------|-----|------|------------|
| **Base** | 55% | Soft landing; inflation contained; Fed holds | +8-12% | 4.0-4.5% | -3-5% | Flat | Flat |

---

## Positioning implications

**Overweight**: International developed equities; gold; quality factor; short-duration credit
**Underweight**: Long-duration Treasuries; China direct exposure; highly leveraged credit
**Hedges**: VIX calls; put spreads on S&P; long JPY vs EM
**Tactical**: Buy dips in tariff-related selloffs (Liberation Day pattern)

---

## Hedging lessons from 2025

1. **Gold worked** — +65% with negative correlation to equities during stress
2. **Put spreads were expensive but paid** — April VIX spike rewarded convexity
3. **International diversification finally paid** — 13pp outperformance
4. **Credit resilience surprised** — HY spreads recovered quickly; staying invested was rewarded
5. **Don't fight the Fed** — Positioning for fewer cuts than consensus was correct
6. **Duration risk was real** — Long bonds underperformed; curve steepened
