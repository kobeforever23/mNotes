# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# QUALITY REQUIREMENTS
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
## Mandatory Standards:
1. **SEARCH FOR CURRENT DATA** — Use web search for all market levels, news, and developments. Do not rely on training data. Verify everything.
2. **NARRATIVE FORMAT** — Write in flowing prose paragraphs. Avoid bullet lists except where absolutely necessary. This should read like a professional intelligence brief, not a checklist.
3. **QUANTIFICATION** — Include specific numbers: prices, spreads, probabilities, dollar impacts, percentages. "Elevated risk" means nothing without "35% probability of 150bps widening."
4. **FORWARD-LOOKING** — 70% forward-looking, 30% backward context. History only matters for what it tells us about the future.
5. **ACTIONABLE** — Every risk requires a "therefore..." Every section should inform a decision.
6. **INTEGRATED** — Connect risks across stripes. A geopolitical event affects market risk, credit risk, and operational risk — show those connections.
7. **EXECUTIVE APPROPRIATE** — Written for a CRO who has 45 minutes to read the whole document. Section I Executive Summary readable in 5 minutes. Clear, confident, direct.
8. **CONTRARIAN CHECK** — Include at least one "consensus may be wrong because..." for each major risk area.
9. **INTELLECTUAL HONESTY** — Acknowledge uncertainty. Distinguish between high-confidence and speculative assessments. Present alternative views where relevant.
10. **PROFESSIONAL FORMATTING** — Use the document header provided. Number sections consistently. Use clear section breaks. This should look like a document from a Tier 1 bank's risk function.
