  - **Energy (XLE) +2.4%**  
  - **Materials (XLB) +1.9%**  
  - **Health Care (XLV) +1.8%**  
  **Sources:**

### Sector/industry news plausibly driving rotation (fact base)
- **Tech/semis:** Intel outlook shock is a direct pressure point for semis.  
  **Sources:** https://www.reuters.com/ ; https://www.barrons.com/ ; https://www.investopedia.com/
- **Energy bid:** Brent crude futures up in premarket coverage (supports energy leadership).  
  **Sources:** https://www.reuters.com/ ; https://www.investing.com/commodities/brent-oil ; https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/TVC-UKOIL/
- **Macro sensitivity:** PMI + sentiment prints matter for cyclical vs defensive positioning (PMI and UoM details above).

## 5) Risk assessment

### Facts (inputs)
- **VIX spot** broadly **mid-teens** (prints ~15.6–16.1 across major venues).  
  **Sources:** https://www.cboe.com/tradable-products/vix/ ; https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/$VIX/overview ; https://www.investing.com/indices/volatility-s-p-500
- **Futures**: S&P roughly flat/down a touch; Nasdaq slightly up to mixed; Dow softer in several snapshots.  
  **Sources:** https://www.investing.com/indices/us-spx-500-futures ; https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/CME_MINI-ES1!/ ; https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/YM*0/overview
- **Narrative shocks:** Intel guidance + geopolitical headlines + central bank commentary are active.  
  **Sources:** https://www.reuters.com/ ; https://www.investing.com/news/ ; https://www.ft.com/

### Analysis (reasoned view)
**Risk environment today: ELEVATED (not HIGH).**  
Mid-teens VIX suggests stress is contained, but the tape is sensitive to single-name earnings shocks (semis) and headline/geopolitical volatility, with macro prints clustered in the morning.

**Top 2–3 market-moving events to watch today**
1) **US macro prints:** PMI + UoM (risk-on/risk-off impulse; rates & USD sensitivity).  
2) **Earnings / guidance spillovers:** especially semis/AI complex given Intel-driven volatility.  
3) **Policy / central bank speaker headlines:** BOJ/ECB/UK MPC speakers can move FX/rates and feed back into US risk appetite.
