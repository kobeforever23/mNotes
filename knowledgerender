Below is the **cleanest, most intuitive explanation** of *why bonds trade*, *why their prices move*, *what drives those moves*, and *how corporate bonds make sense economically*.
I’ll give you **deep intuition first**, then **practical trader logic**, then **corporate bond–specific intuition**, and finally **simple examples** that make everything “click.”

# **1. Bonds Exist Because People Want to Trade “Time” and “Risk”**

At the absolute core:

### **A bond = money today in exchange for money tomorrow.**

A bond is literally a *contract for future cashflows*.
But what moves prices?

### **Because different people disagree about:**

1. **The value of money today vs. the future (interest rates).**
2. **The chance the borrower fails (credit risk).**
3. **Their own need for liquidity (buy/sell pressure).**

So bonds trade whenever:

* interest rate expectations change
* default risk changes
* liquidity changes
* macro outlook changes
* one investor needs cash today
* another has too much cash and wants yield

Bond trading is the market’s way of **constantly repricing time + credit risk**.

# **2. Interest Rates Give the First Layer of Intuition**

### **When rates go up → existing bonds go down. Why?**

Because a 5% coupon bond is unattractive if new bonds now pay 7%.

You must drop the **price** until that older bond *yields 7% too*.

That’s it.
This is the single most fundamental intuition:

> **Bond price moves to equalize yield with the new market level.**

### Why do rates change?

Because:

* the Fed changes policy
* inflation expectations move
* growth expectations move
* supply/demand changes (“Treasury issuing tons of bonds”)

Rates are the *base price* for all bonds.

# **3. Credit Risk Gives the Second Layer of Intuition**

Corporate bonds add a second risk:

### **“Will this company pay me back with high probability?”**

If a company becomes riskier:

* losing money
* leverage rising
* sector worsening
* bad earnings
* M&A event
* litigation
* downgrades

then investors demand:

### **Higher credit spread → lower bond price**

A bond’s corporate yield = treasury yield + credit spread

So a simple equation is:

[
\text{Corporate Yield} = \text{Risk-Free Rate} + \text{Credit Spread}
]

If credit spread widens from 120 bps to 200 bps, price falls to reflect the higher yield required for risk.

---

# **4. Liquidity and Flows Give the Third Layer**

Corporate bonds trade OTC.
There is no exchange.
This creates **friction** and **opportunity**.

### Prices move because:

* a big PM must sell $50M quickly
* dealers pull back from warehousing risk
* ETFs (LQD, HYG) see inflows/outflows
* hedge funds need to de-risk
* CLOs rotate portfolios
* insurance accounts rebalance

These players don’t value bonds the same way.
So they trade, and prices move.

# **5. Very Simple Intuition That Finally Makes It “Click”**

### A bond trades for 3 reasons:

#### **(1) The “base price of time” changes → Treasury yields move**

Think of this like saying:

* Future dollars are now worth less than before
* So present cashflows get discounted more
  → Bond prices fall

#### **(2) The “risk premium” changes → credit spreads move**

The world starts worrying more or less about a company’s ability to pay.

#### **(3) Someone really needs to buy/sell → liquidity premia shift**

Flows create price pressure separate from fundamentals.

That’s it.

Everything in bond trading is built on these three intuitions.

# **6. Why Corporate Bonds Specifically Move (Simple but Deep)**

Imagine a corporate bond:

📌 **5% coupon**
📌 **10-year maturity**
📌 **Issued by Apple**

When price moves, what is it saying?

### **If price falls**

The market is saying:
“You must compensate me MORE to lend to you (higher yield).”

Why?

1. **Rates moved up** (Treasuries up → all yields must go up)
2. **Credit got riskier** (spread must widen)
3. **Liquidity worsened** (dealers stopped making tight markets)
4. **Macro worsened** (recession concerns)
5. **Flows** (ETF outflows → forced selling)

### **If price rises**

The market is saying:
“I am OK accepting LESS compensation (lower yield).”

Why?

* Rates down
* Credit better
* Flows buying
* Sector rally
* Fed easing cycle
* Strong earnings (default risk down)

# **7. Putting It Together With the Trader Mindset**

## **Sell-Side Trader Intuition**

Your job is to:

* warehouse risk
* manage bid/ask spreads
* deliver liquidity
* hedge interest rate exposure with futures/swaps
* hedge credit exposure with CDS

Sell-side traders don’t hold bonds for long.
They buy because **clients want to sell**, and they sell because **clients want to buy**.

They profit from:

* spread capture
* smart positioning
* flow information
* relative value (RV)

They see bonds as **interchangeable risk units**:

* DV01 (rate risk)
* CS01 (credit risk)
* Liquidity premium
* Optionality

## **Buy-Side Trader (PM) Intuition**

Your job is to:

* maximize risk-adjusted return
* size positions based on conviction
* forecast macro + credit cycle
* manage liquidity and redemption risk
* express sector or issuer-level views

Buy-side traders hold bonds because they find:

* cheap credit spreads
* mispriced rates
* mispriced curve shape
* dislocations between bonds & CDS

They profit from:

* carry
* roll-down
* tightening spreads
* falling rates
* sector rotation
* thematic macro trades
* pair trades

# **8. The Most Intuitive Example: A Corporate Bond Drops 5 Points—Why?**

Imagine **Amazon** 2032 corporate bond.

Yesterday: 102
Today: 97

### What could have driven this?

#### **Scenario A — Rates up 30bps**

Treasuries sell off → every bond’s discount rate rises.

#### **Scenario B — Credit spreads widened 40bps**

Perhaps:

* weak earnings
* debt issuance
* downgrade risk
* sector-wide selloff
* recession fears

#### **Scenario C — Forced selling**

A PM gets redemptions
→ must sell bonds
→ dealers lower bids
→ price temporarily depressed

#### **Scenario D — ETF outflows (LQD, HYG)**

ETFs dump bonds mechanically
→ dealers reduce risk appetite
→ spreads widen

#### **Scenario E — Liquidity dried up**

Year-end
FOMC day
Quarter end
Holiday week
→ Wider bid/ask → lower “market-clearing” prices

# **9. The Single Best Mental Model to Keep in Your Head**

### **Bond value = Present value of future cashflows**

discounted at
**risk-free rate + credit spread + liquidity premium**

And every second of every day:

* markets update the discount rate
* markets update credit spreads
* markets update liquidity premia

Bonds trade because **views change**, **flows hit**, and **risk needs change**.

---

# **10. Want It in One Perfect Intuitive Sentence?**

> **A bond’s price is just the market’s constantly updated opinion about the fairness of lending money to someone — at that point in time — given interest rates, credit risk, and liquidity needs.**
