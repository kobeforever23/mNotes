Here’s a **simple, mechanical way** to “convert” any **base scenario** (e.g., a *Severe Rates Rally / flight-to-quality*) into the **AI Severe** scenario you want — **by asset class** and then **granularly** (indices → sectors/buckets → single names; plus credit + vol surface).

The key idea is: **treat your target AI-Severe scenario as a shock vector**, and compute an **overlay (delta) vector** that you apply **on top of** the base scenario.

---

## 1) One rule that makes this easy

### A. For anything that is a **price return** (equities, ETFs, indices)

Use **multiplicative add-on returns** so you don’t break math on big moves:

[
R_{\text{add}} ;=; \frac{1+R_{\text{target}}}{1+R_{\text{base}}} - 1
]

Then the combined scenario is:

[
(1+R_{\text{base}})(1+R_{\text{add}}) - 1 ;=; R_{\text{target}}
]

This matters because going from “base −10%” to “target −50%” is **not** “add −40%” in a strictly correct sense.

### B. For **rates / spreads in bps**

Use simple additive deltas:

[
\Delta_{\text{add}} = \Delta_{\text{target}} - \Delta_{\text{base}}
]

### C. For **levels** (VIX, VVIX, MOVE, DXY level, etc.)

Either:

* **set-to-target** (cleanest), or
* **additive**: `Level_add = Level_target − Level_base`

### D. For **vol surfaces**

Use a structured “shift”:

* **ATM level shift** by tenor (e.g., +X vol points for 1M)
* **skew steepening** (e.g., 25Δ put – ATM widens by +Y)
* **term structure inversion** (front-end rises more than back-end)

---

## 2) Define the target: “AI Severe” shock vector (what you want to end at)

Below is a clean **target** for the AI-Severe scenario (60 trading days), consistent with what you described:

### Asset-class targets (AI Severe)

**Rates / safe havens**

* UST 10Y yield: **−80 bp**
* UST 2Y yield: **−110 bp**
* 2s10s: **steepen +60 bp** (because 2Y falls more)
* DXY: **+6%**
* Gold: **+15%**

**Equities**

* AI single names (NVDA, AMD, AVGO cohort): **−50%**
* AI-exposed utilities (VST, CEG): **−30%**
* QQQ: **≈ −50%**
* SPX: **≈ −47%**

**Credit spreads (OAS)**

* IG overall: **+200 bp widening**
* HY overall: **+420 bp widening**
* Tech/Semis IG: **+260 bp**
* Tech/Semis HY: **+600 bp**
* Software IG: **+240 bp**
* Utilities IG: **+150 bp**

**Volatility**

* VIX spot: **58**
* VVIX: **~165** (ballpark for vol-of-vol stress)
* SPX skew (1M):

  * 25Δ put skew: **+8 vol pts steeper vs current**
  * 10Δ put skew: **+12 vol pts steeper vs current**
* Term structure: **deep inversion** (front > back, front/back ratio > 1.15)

**Correlation regime**

* SPX implied corr (1M): **0.85**
* QQQ implied corr (1M): **0.88**
* Intra-AI cohort corr: **0.95**

---

## 3) The “converter”: overlay your base scenario to hit AI-Severe

### Step-by-step workflow

1. **Write down your base scenario shocks** (the severe rates rally you already have) for:

* 2Y, 10Y, curve
* SPX, QQQ (or sector/index proxies)
* IG/HY OAS (or CDX)
* VIX / skew
* DXY / gold

2. **Compute the overlay** = Target − Base (or multiplicative add-on for returns)

3. Apply:

* Base shocks first
* Then overlay shocks

---

## 4) By asset class: base → target → overlay (template + example)

Below is a template you can literally copy into Excel.

### 4A) Rates / FX / commodities (bps or % additive)

| Factor  | Base “Severe Rates Rally” (example) | Target AI-Severe |             Overlay to apply |
| ------- | ----------------------------------: | ---------------: | ---------------------------: |
| UST 10Y |                             −100 bp |           −80 bp | **+20 bp** (undo some rally) |
| UST 2Y  |                             −150 bp |          −110 bp |                   **+40 bp** |
| 2s10s   |                              +50 bp |           +60 bp |                   **+10 bp** |
| DXY     |                                 +3% |              +6% |                      **+3%** |
| Gold    |                                +10% |             +15% |                      **+5%** |

> If your base is different, just do: `Overlay = Target − Base`.

---

### 4B) Equity returns (use the multiplicative add-on)

Let’s say your **base severe rates rally** implies (example):

* SPX = −12%
* QQQ = −15%

Targets are:

* SPX = −47%
* QQQ = −50%

Compute the add-on:

[
R_{\text{add}} = \frac{1+R_{\text{target}}}{1+R_{\text{base}}} - 1
]

**SPX add-on**

* (R_{add} = 0.53/0.88 - 1 = -0.3977) → **−39.8%**

**QQQ add-on**

* (R_{add} = 0.50/0.85 - 1 = -0.4118) → **−41.2%**

So you’d apply:

* Base: SPX −12%, then overlay: SPX **−39.8%**
* Base: QQQ −15%, then overlay: QQQ **−41.2%**

This guarantees you land exactly on **−47%** and **−50%**.

> If your base scenario has equities *up* (possible in a pure rates rally), this method still works and will produce a larger negative overlay, which is exactly what you need.

---

### 4C) Credit spreads (bps additive)

Example base:

* IG +60 bp
* HY +200 bp

Target AI-severe:

* IG +200 bp
* HY +420 bp

Overlay:

* IG: **+140 bp**
* HY: **+220 bp**

---

### 4D) Vol levels (set-to-target is simplest)

Example base:

* VIX = 32

Target:

* VIX = 58

Overlay:

* **+26 VIX points** (or just “set VIX to 58”)

For skew, you typically apply **relative** steepening vs ATM (more robust across regimes):

* Add **+8 vol pts** to (25Δ put – ATM) at 1M
* Add **+12 vol pts** to (10Δ put – ATM) at 1M
* Enforce **front-end inversion**: 1W and 1M rise more than 6M and 1Y

---

## 5) More granular: equity shocks from “macro base” to “AI-Severe” target

This is the part most people struggle with, so here’s a **clean hierarchy** you can implement.

### 5A) Equity bucket map (targets)

Use these buckets and targets (AI-Severe):

**AI Infrastructure (binding / core)**

* NVDA, AMD, AVGO: **−50%**

**AI software / cloud exposed**

* MSFT, CRM, PLTR, NOW: **−45%** (AI monetization + multiple compression)

**AI enablers / power**

* VST, CEG: **−30%** (binding constraint)

**Mag-7 non-pure AI spillover**

* AAPL, GOOGL, AMZN, META: **−40%**

**Rest of QQQ**

* **−35%**

**Non-tech SPX remainder**

* **−25%** (risk-off + correlation spike)

Then aggregate should land you near:

* **QQQ ~ −50%**
* **SPX ~ −47%**

### 5B) How to overlay from a base scenario at the bucket level

If your base scenario already has (example) broad tech down −20%, you *don’t* want to double count.
Compute an add-on per bucket using the same return formula:

[
R_{\text{add,bucket}} = \frac{1+R_{\text{target,bucket}}}{1+R_{\text{base,bucket}}} - 1
]

**Example**

* Base “severe rates rally” says Semis bucket is −25%
* Target AI severe says Semis bucket (NVDA/AMD/AVGO) is −50%

Add-on:

* (R_{add}=0.50/0.75-1=-0.333) → **−33.3% overlay** on that bucket

This way the AI-specific crash is explicitly the overlay, not hidden in a mushy “tech down” factor.

---

## 6) More granular: credit overlay by sector (so tech gets hit harder)

If your base scenario widens credit fairly uniformly (common), your AI scenario needs **sector beta**.

Use a simple rule:

* **Tech/Semis spreads widen = 1.3× to 1.5× IG widening**
* **Utilities widen = 0.6× to 0.8× IG widening**

### Target sector spread widenings (AI severe)

* IG overall: +200
* Tech/Semis IG: +260
* Software IG: +240
* Utilities IG: +150

So if base has IG +60 and no sector differentiation:

* Overlay IG = +140
* Overlay Tech IG = +200 (to get from +60 → +260)
* Overlay Utilities IG = +90 (to get from +60 → +150)

Same logic for HY sector overlays.

---

## 7) More granular: vol surface overlay (simple but structured)

Most risk engines do poorly if you just “set VIX.” So here’s a practical surface recipe.

### 7A) SPX surface targets (AI severe)

**ATM levels (illustrative structure)**

* 1W IV: **~75–85**
* 1M IV: **~55–60** (VIX ~58)
* 3M IV: **~40–45**
* 6M IV: **~32–36**
* 1Y IV: **~28–32**

**Skew**

* 25Δ put – ATM (1M): **steepen by +8 vol pts**
* 10Δ put – ATM (1M): **steepen by +12 vol pts**

**Term structure**

* Force inversion: (1M / 6M) ratio **> 1.15**

### 7B) Single-name IV targets (AI severe)

Apply by cohort (30D IV):

* AI Infrastructure (NVDA/AMD/AVGO): **90–110%**
* AI Software (CRM/PLTR/NOW): **75–95%**
* AI Utilities (VST/CEG): **60–75%**
* Mega-cap diversified (MSFT/GOOGL/AMZN): **55–70%**

Overlay method (simple):

* If base already lifts single-name IV by +15 vol points, and target needs +50:

  * overlay **+35 vol points**
* If your system uses multipliers, you can do: `IV_target = IV_base × k` with higher k in front-end.

---

## 8) If you want the *simplest operational implementation* (what many desks do)

### “Two-layer scenario” approach

1. **Run your base scenario** (“severe rates rally”) as-is
2. Add a named overlay layer: **“AI Valuation Crash + Credit Contagion”**, which contains:

* Equity bucket overrides (NVDA/AMD/AVGO = −50, etc.)
* Sector spread differentials (tech wider than IG)
* Vol surface inversion + skew steepening
* Correlation regime set (SPX corr 0.85, AI corr 0.95)

This is clean, auditable, and avoids fighting with whatever equity response your rates scenario implies.

---

## 9) Quick “cheat sheet” you can paste into a scenario note

**To convert Base Severe Rates Rally → AI Severe:**

* **Rates:** adjust to target (10Y −80bp, 2Y −110bp, curve +60bp) via additive bps deltas.
* **Equities:** apply *multiplicative overlay returns* so you land exactly on:

  * SPX −47%, QQQ −50%
  * NVDA/AMD/AVGO −50%
  * VST/CEG −30%
  * AI software −45%, Mag7 spillover −40%, rest QQQ −35%, non-tech SPX −25%
* **Credit:** widen to target with sector beta (Tech/Semis IG +260, HY +600; Utilities IG +150).
* **Vol:** set VIX to 58 + force surface inversion + skew steepening (+8 vol pts at 25Δ; +12 at 10Δ).
* **Correlation:** set SPX 0.85 / QQQ 0.88 / AI cohort 0.95.

---

If you share *your actual base scenario shock table* (even just: 2Y/10Y, SPX/QQQ, IG/HY, VIX, DXY, gold), I can compute the **exact overlay numbers** for each asset class and each equity/credit bucket using the formulas above, so you can drop it straight into your scenario library.
